Test 1: If N equals the dataset size

Arrange: Identify the dataset with 5 records. Choose N = 5. Have a custom object prepared to store records.

Act: Store the first N records from the dataset into the custom object.

Assert: The custom object should contain all 5 records, in the same order as in the dataset.

Test 2: If N is larger than the dataset size

Arrange: Identify the dataset with 4 records. Choose N = 10. Have a custom object prepared to store records.

Act: Attempt to store the first N records from the dataset into the custom object.

Assert: The custom object should contain all 4 available records (not 10).



Problem 3 Test: Display a horizontal text-based histogram of the ages

Test 1: Basic multi-age histogram

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [10, 12, 10, 11]. Use * as the bar character.

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:
10: **
11: *
12: *

Test 2: Single-age dataset

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [7, 7, 7]. Use * as the bar character.

Act: Generate and print the histogram.

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:

7: ***

Test 3: Empty dataset (no valid ages)

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [] (empty).

Act: Attempt to generate and print the histogram.

Assert: The program should print:

No data to display.

Test 4: Dataset includes invalid/negative ages which must be ignored

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [-1, 10, 10, -5, 11]. Negative ages are invalid and should be ignored by the histogram logic. Use * as the bar character.

Act: Filter out invalid ages, generate and print the histogram for the remaining ages.

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:

10: **
11: *


Problem 5 Test: Total number of records for each number of children

Test 1: If number of children is zero

Arrange: Identify the ages of the clients in the dataset. Choose a cutoff age for what counts as a child. Create a total variable to track the number of clients who are children. In this dataset, all ages are above the cutoff age.

Act: Count the total number of clients whose ages are greater than 0 and less than or equal to the cutoff age.

Assert: The total number of records for children is: 0.

Test 2: Multiple children of varying ages

Arrange: Identify the ages of the clients in the dataset (for example: 5, 7, 17, 25, 30). Choose a cutoff age of 17. Create a total variable to track the number of clients who are children.

Act: Count the total number of clients whose ages are greater than 0 and less than or equal to 17.

Assert: The total number of records for children is: 3.


Problem 7 Test: Determine if the dataset is “fair”

Test 1: Perfectly balanced dataset

Arrange: Identify the dataset of records grouped by region. Suppose there are 100 total records, evenly split across 4 regions (25 per region).

Act: Compare the percentage of records in each region.

Assert: Since all regions have exactly 25%, the differences are 0%, which is within the 5% tolerance. The data is fair.Problem 7 Test: Determine if the dataset is “fair”


Test 2: Slight imbalance within 5%

Arrange: Identify the dataset of 100 records, split across 2 regions: Region A = 52 records, Region B = 48 records.

Act: Compare the percentage of records per region. Region A = 52%, Region B = 48%.

Assert: The difference is 4%, which is within the 5% tolerance. The data is fair.

Test 3: Multiple regions with one outlier

Arrange: Identify the dataset of 100 records across 3 regions: Region A = 30, Region B = 33, Region C = 37.

Act: Compare the percentage of records per region. A = 30%, B = 33%, C = 37%.

Assert: The largest difference is 7% (30% vs. 37%), which exceeds the 5% tolerance. The data is not fair.

Test 4: Empty dataset

Arrange: Identify the dataset with 0 records across all regions.

Act: Attempt to calculate fairness.

Assert: With no data available, fairness cannot be determined. The program should either report “No data available” or treat the dataset as not fair.

Problem 9 Test: Compare charge ranges for BMI groups

Test 1: BMI 30–45 range is clearly larger

Arrange: Identify dataset of charges grouped by BMI:

Group 1 (<30): charges [1000, 1500] → range = 500

Group 2 (30–45): charges [2000, 4000] → range = 2000

Group 3 (>45): charges [3000, 3500] → range = 500

Act: Calculate the charge range for each BMI group and compare them.

Assert: Group 2’s range (2000) is greater than both Group 1 (500) and Group 3 (500). The statement is true.

Test 2: BMI 30–45 range is not the largest

Arrange: Identify dataset of charges grouped by BMI:

Group 1 (<30): charges [1000, 4000] → range = 3000

Group 2 (30–45): charges [2000, 3500] → range = 1500

Group 3 (>45): charges [2500, 3000] → range = 500

Act: Calculate the charge range for each BMI group and compare them.

Assert: Group 1’s range (3000) is greater than Group 2 (1500). The statement is false.

Test 3: All groups have equal ranges

Arrange: Identify dataset of charges grouped by BMI:

Group 1 (<30): charges [1000, 2000] → range = 1000

Group 2 (30–45): charges [3000, 4000] → range = 1000

Group 3 (>45): charges [5000, 6000] → range = 1000

Act: Calculate the charge range for each BMI group and compare them.

Assert: All groups have the same range (1000). The statement is false, because the 30–45 group is not greater.


Problem 11 Test: Do smokers have higher charges and a wider range than non-smokers?

Test 1: Smokers have both higher mean and wider range (hypothesis true)

Arrange: Create a dataset split by smoker status with charges:

Smokers: [5000, 7000, 9000] → mean = 7000, range = 4000

Non-smokers: [1000, 2000, 3000] → mean = 2000, range = 2000

Act: Calculate mean and range for smokers and non-smokers; compare smoker mean > non-smoker mean AND smoker range > non-smoker range.

Assert: Both conditions hold (7000 > 2000 and 4000 > 2000). The hypothesis is true for this dataset.

Test 2: Smokers have higher mean but not a wider range (hypothesis false)

Arrange: Create a dataset:

Smokers: [4000, 5000, 6000] → mean = 5000, range = 2000

Non-smokers: [1000, 3000, 5000] → mean = 3000, range = 4000

Act: Calculate mean and range for both groups and compare.

Assert: Smoker mean > non-smoker mean (5000 > 3000) but smoker range < non-smoker range (2000 < 4000). Because the hypothesis requires both higher mean and wider range, the hypothesis is false for this dataset.

Test 3: Smokers have wider range but not higher mean (hypothesis false)

Arrange: Create a dataset:

Smokers: [1000, 9000] → mean = 5000, range = 8000

Non-smokers: [4000, 4500, 5000] → mean = 4500, range = 1000

Act: Calculate mean and range for both groups and compare.

Assert: Smoker range > non-smoker range (8000 > 1000) but smoker mean > non-smoker mean is only slightly true (5000 > 4500) — if mean is greater, both conditions might hold; to demonstrate the opposite, change numbers so mean is not greater. (Alternate example below.)

Alternate Arrange (means not higher):

Smokers: [1000, 9000] (mean 5000)

Non-smokers: [6000, 6000] (mean 6000, range 0)

Act: Recalculate.

Assert (alternate): Smoker range > non-smoker range (8000 > 0) but smoker mean < non-smoker mean (5000 < 6000). The hypothesis is false.

The statement is true: smokers average lower BMI than non-smokers.

Test 2: Smokers have higher average BMI (statement false)

Arrange: Dataset with BMI values:

Smokers: [29, 30, 31] → mean = 30

Non-smokers: [22, 24, 26] → mean = 24

Assert: Since 30 > 24, the output should be:
The statement is false: smokers do not average lower BMI than non-smokers.

Test 3: Smokers and non-smokers have equal average BMI (statement false)

Arrange: Dataset with BMI values:

Smokers: [25, 27, 29] → mean = 27

Non-smokers: [26, 28, 27] → mean = 27

Act: Calculate the mean BMI for smokers and non-smokers.
