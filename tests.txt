Problem 1 Test: Store the first N records of the dataset in a custom object

Test 1: If N equals the dataset size

Arrange: Identify the dataset with 5 records. Choose N = 5. Have a custom object prepared to store records.

Act: Store the first N records from the dataset into the custom object.

Assert: The custom object should contain all 5 records, in the same order as in the dataset.

Test 2: If N is larger than the dataset size

Arrange: Identify the dataset with 4 records. Choose N = 10. Have a custom object prepared to store records.

Act: Attempt to store the first N records from the dataset into the custom object.

Assert: The custom object should contain all 4 available records (not 10).



Problem 3 Test: Display a horizontal text-based histogram of the ages

Test 1: Basic multi-age histogram

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [10, 12, 10, 11]. Use * as the bar character.

Act: Generate and print the histogram (one line per age present, ascending).

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:
10: **
11: *
12: *

Test 2: Single-age dataset

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [7, 7, 7]. Use * as the bar character.

Act: Generate and print the histogram.

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:

7: ***

Test 3: Empty dataset (no valid ages)

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [] (empty).

Act: Attempt to generate and print the histogram.

Assert: The program should print:

No data to display.

Test 4: Dataset includes invalid/negative ages which must be ignored

Arrange: Dataset of client ages: [-1, 10, 10, -5, 11]. Negative ages are invalid and should be ignored by the histogram logic. Use * as the bar character.

Act: Filter out invalid ages, generate and print the histogram for the remaining ages.

Assert: The printed histogram should be exactly:

10: **
11: *
